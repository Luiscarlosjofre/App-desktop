##  **DESKTOP APP G&C v2.0**

***This application is a CRUD, which in computing is the acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is used to refer to basic functions in databases. The main advantage of this application -apart from the speed to execute the processes, given that its controls and events occur on the same computer- is to offer usability without an internet connection, being functional at any time providing a benefit over web applications, as long as it is connected to a database locally. Now, the disadvantage that this desktop application has, is the maintenance of its updates, whenever it requires it, you will have to go through each of the workstations to run the update :) This project is being developed with Python Technology, Tkinter, MySQL Community Server for The Database and much, much  *** ❤️

	It is worth remembering that the database must be backed up periodically. This application allows you to export a. CSV to your computer with all the 		records of your database.

**What is Open Source Software?**

	Open source software is code designed in a way that is accessible to the public: everyone can view, modify, and distribute the code in any way they see 	fit. Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, so it depends on the peer review and community production. In addition, 	 it is usually cheaper, more flexible and durable than its proprietary alternatives, since those responsible for its development are the communities and 	 not a single author or a single company. Open source became a movement and a way of working that transcends production of the software. Adopts the 		values and decentralized production model of open source software to find new ways to solve problems in communities.
